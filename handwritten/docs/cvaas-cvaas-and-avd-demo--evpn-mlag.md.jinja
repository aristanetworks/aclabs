# How To Use The Lab

???+ Tip "Wait until all devices will start streaming to CVaaS."

    This may take a while.

```bash
# 2. build configs with AVD
make build
# 3. create CVP change control (1)
make deploy_cvp
# 4. assign tags for CVP topology view (2)
make tags
# 5. validate the deployment with ANTA preview
make test
```

1. !!! Tip "Review and execute the change control on CVP when all tasks will be created."
2. !!! Bug "Currently there is a bug with disabling LLDP on Ma0, which prevents topology view from functioning correctly."

Connect to a host (h01 or h02) and execute `test` alias to confirm connectivity.  
Execute following commands to verify EVPN control plane:

```text
show ip bgp summary
show bgp evpn summary
show bgp evpn route-type ip-prefix ipv4
show bgp evpn route-type mac-ip
```

Do any other testing in the lab.  
Impress your customer, colleagues or make yourself a bit smarter and happier.
