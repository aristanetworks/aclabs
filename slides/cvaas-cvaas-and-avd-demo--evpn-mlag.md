# What is Ansible AVD?

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](assets/img/cvaas-cvaas-and-avd-demo--evpn-mlag/provisioning-building-blocks.png)

- [AVD](https://avd.arista.com/) stands for Arista Validated Design as it was based on the [EVPN Deployment Guide](https://www.arista.com/custom_data/downloads/?f=/support/download/DesignGuides/EVPN_Deployment_Guide.pdf)
- A very successful community project used to deploy EVPN based Data Center fabrics
  - Over [299 stars on Github](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd) and 108 contributors as of Nov 2023
  - The most active Arista collection on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/arista/avd)
- High level workflow:
  - Define abstracted group/host vars using AVD data model
  - Generate low level device specific variables (aka structured configs)
  - Parse templates, build plain text configs
  - Deliver configs to network devices using Ansible `arista.eos.eos_config`

# Facts About CVaaS

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- CVaaS is cloud based
- Customers are assigned to a region with disaster recovery plan relying on [availability zones (AZ)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones)
- CVaaS backups are multi-region
- CVaaS is maintained by a dedicated Cloud SRE team and is always up to date
- Users authenticate to CVaaS via OAuth/SAML providers: Google, Okta, OneLogin, Microsoft Azure AD and custom SAML/OAuth providers
- The API access for AVD orchestration, etc. is authenticated using service account tokens
- The only traffic required is HTTPS initiated by switch to CVaaS with cert based authentication and HTTPS from AVD host to CVaaS with token based authentication

# The Demo

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](assets/img/cvaas-cvaas-and-avd-demo--evpn-mlag/demo-setup.png)

- Start container as Github Codespace (or on any host with dev container supporting tool)
- Start a simple leaf-spine topology in Containerlab
- Build EVPN configuration with `arista.avd` Ansible collection
- Wait until the lab switches will start streaming using a pre-defined token
- Deploy configuration to CVP using `arista.avd` Ansible collection and pre-defined API token
- Create change control, review and execute the change
