## How To Run The Demo

???+ Tip "Wait until cEOS-lab image will be imported"

    You can confirm if image was imported correctly with `docker image ls`.  
    Sometimes cEOS-lab image download may fail. For example, due to incorrect token.  
    In that case you can upload the image manually by right-clicking the Explorer tab of the VSCode interface.
