## How To Run The Lab on Your Machine

It is possible to run the lab on your local machine (or any server) instead of using Github Codespaces.  
You can [download all required lab files here](https://{% raw %}{{gh.org_name}}{%endraw%}.github.io/one-click-se-demos/lab_archives/{{ .__lab_slug }}.tar.gz).  
However you must take care of you VSCode setup and setting up environment variables. Also keep in mind that auto-downloaded image will not work on ARM-based MacBooks.

## How To Run The Demo

???+ Tip "Wait until cEOS-lab image will be imported"

    You can confirm if image was imported correctly with `docker image ls`.  
    In some rare cases the cEOS-lab image may fail to be downloaded.
    For example due to incorrecte token or other API failure on arista.com.  
    In that case you can upload the image manually by right-clicking the Explorer tab of the VSCode interface.

```bash
# 1. start cLab
make start
```

???+ Tip "Wait until all devices will start streaming to CVaaS."

    This may take a while.
