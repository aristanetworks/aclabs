## How To Run The Lab

You can run the lab on [Github Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/{{gh.repository}}/tree/{{gh.branch}}?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fcvaas-cvaas-and-avd-demo--evpn-mlag%2Fdevcontainer.json) or your own machine.

> WARNING: Currently only x86 hosts are supported. cEOS-lab for ARM is not yet available and it's not possible to start the lab on your MacBook yet.

???+ Tip "Wait until the lab is ready"

    When lab container starts, the `postCreate.sh` takes care of cEOS-lab image download and making some last minute changes in the lab environment. After that, `make start` shortcut is executed to start the lab.
    This requires a some time. :stopwatch: Please be patient. :coffee: :croissant:
    Sometimes cEOS-lab image download may fail. For example, due to incorrect token. In that case `postCreate.sh` script will fail and the lab will not be started.  
    You can confirm if image was imported correctly with `docker image ls`.

# How To Use The Lab

???+ Tip "Wait until all devices will start streaming to CVaaS."

    This may take a while.

```bash
# 2. build configs with AVD
make build
# 3. create CVP change control (1)
make deploy_cvp
# 4. assign tags for CVP topology view (2)
make tags
# 5. validate the deployment with ANTA preview
make test
```

1. !!! Tip "Review and execute the change control on CVP when all tasks will be created."
2. !!! Bug "Currently there is a bug with disabling LLDP on Ma0, which prevents topology view from functioning correctly."

Connect to a host (h01 or h02) and execute `test` alias to confirm connectivity.  
Execute following commands to verify EVPN control plane:

```text
show ip bgp summary
show bgp evpn summary
show bgp evpn route-type ip-prefix ipv4
show bgp evpn route-type mac-ip
```

Do any other testing in the lab.  
Impress your customer, colleagues or make yourself a bit smarter and happier.  
You rock! ðŸš€
