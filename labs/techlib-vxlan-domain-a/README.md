## Building Configurations with AVD

Pre-built AVD data models are located in the `avd/group_vars` directory. These data models will render configurations for the nodes in Domain A as shown in the EVPN/VXLAN Deployment Guide.

Issuing the below command at the terminal will render all configuration and documentation based on the pre-built data models.

```bash
make build
```

> [!TIP]
> Be sure to explore and experiment with the data models! More information on AVD can be found at https://avd.arista.com.

## Deploying Configurations with AVD

Once rendered, the AVD-generated configurations can be deployed to the nodes by issuing the below command at the terminal

```bash
make deploy
```

## Validating the Environment with AVD

The [Arista Network Test Automation (ANTA)](https://anta.arista.com/) framework can be used to validate that the topology is built and operational as defined in the AVD data models.

Issue the below command at the terminal will initiate the validation testing.

```bash
make validate
```

> [!TIP]
> ANTA has an extensive and continually growing [test catalog](https://anta.arista.com/stable/api/tests/). Be sure to explore and test with the available options!

Happy Labbing!
